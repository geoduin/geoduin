## Introduction

My name is Xin Wang and I am a software engineering student at the university of applied sciences of Avans Breda.
I like the development process of thinking and implementing the solution of software, because I like to create or implement new things. And I am very happy if the solution solves important problems.

As long as I have lived, do I always strive to learn skills and things whether it is a programming language or hobby. 

In the short term, I want to become graduate at Avans to become a competent data-engineer and maybe a data-scientist at a mid to big company.
